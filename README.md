# GoF - Design Patterns

In software engineering, a software design pattern is a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design.
It's a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations. Design patterns are formalized best practices that the programmer can use to solve common problems when designing an application or system.

```
Design patterns gained popularity in computer science after the book Design Patterns: 
Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software was published in 1994 by the so-called "Gang of Four"
```

## Classification

Design patterns had originally been categorized into 3 sub-classifications based on kind of problem they solve.

* <strong>Creational patterns</strong> provide the capability to create objects based on a required criteria and in a controlled way.
    * <a href="https://github.com/mauriciogeneroso/gof-design-patterns/tree/master/src/com/generoso/study/creational/abstractfactory">Abstract Factory</a>
    * <a href="https://github.com/mauriciogeneroso/gof-design-patterns/tree/master/src/com/generoso/study/creational/builder">Builder</a>
    * <a href="https://github.com/mauriciogeneroso/gof-design-patterns/tree/master/src/com/generoso/study/creational/factorymethod">Factory Method</a>
    * <a href="https://github.com/mauriciogeneroso/gof-design-patterns/tree/master/src/com/generoso/study/creational/prototype">Prototype</a>
    * <a href="https://github.com/mauriciogeneroso/gof-design-patterns/tree/master/src/com/generoso/study/creational/singleton">Singleton</a>
* <strong>Structural patterns</strong> are about organizing different classes and objects to form larger structures and provide new functionality.
    * Adapter
    * Bridge
    * Composite
    * Decorator
    * Facade
    * Flyweight
    * Proxy
* <strong>Behavioral patterns</strong> are about identifying common communication patterns between objects and realize these patterns.
    * Chain of Responsability
    * Command
    * Interpreter
    * Iterator
    * Mediator
    * Memento
    * Observer
    * State
    * Strategy
    * Template method
    * Visitor
